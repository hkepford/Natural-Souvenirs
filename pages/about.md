## About the Collection

This collection of natural souvenirs features objects that I have collected over the years, with locations spanning from Iowa to Italy. You will find:

- Interesting rocks
- Shells
- Pine cones
- And so much more!

##Collection History

Throughout the years I have always enjoyed finding beauty in the small things, and these small things are often pieces of nature. Often when visiting a new place I will pick up a small souvenir and I find myself loving the memories they remind me of.
